# Quick Start Guide - Breast Cancer Prediction System

## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies (First Time Only)
```bash
cd c:\CSC415\Breast_Cancer_Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Train the Model (First Time Only)
```bash
python model_development.py
```
This will:
- Load the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset
- Train the Logistic Regression model
- Save all model files to `models/` directory
- Display model performance metrics

**Expected Output:**
- ✅ Model trained with 88.60% accuracy
- ✅ Model saved successfully
- ✅ All preprocessing artifacts saved

### 3️⃣ Run the Web Application
```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## 📝 Using the Application

### To Make a Prediction:
1. Enter 5 tumor characteristics:
   - **Radius Mean**: 0-50
   - **Texture Mean**: 0-50
   - **Area Mean**: 0-3000
   - **Smoothness Mean**: 0-1
   - **Compactness Mean**: 0-1

2. Click **"Analyze Tumor"** button

3. View the prediction:
   - Diagnosis (Benign or Malignant)
   - Confidence percentage
   - Probability visualization

### Sample Test Data:

**Benign Case:**
- Radius Mean: 14.5
- Texture Mean: 19.3
- Area Mean: 456.2
- Smoothness Mean: 0.0873
- Compactness Mean: 0.0846

**Malignant Case:**
- Radius Mean: 20.5
- Texture Mean: 25.3
- Area Mean: 800.0
- Smoothness Mean: 0.1234
- Compactness Mean: 0.2543

## 📊 What You'll See

### Model Metrics Dashboard
- **Accuracy**: 88.60% - Overall prediction correctness
- **Precision**: 0.9403 - When it says malignant, it's correct 94% of time
- **Recall**: 0.8750 - Catches 87.5% of actual malignant cases
- **F1-Score**: 0.9065 - Balanced performance measure
- **ROC AUC**: 0.9729 - Excellent discrimination ability

### Prediction Result
- ✅ Clear benign/malignant diagnosis
- ✅ Confidence percentage
- ✅ Probability bars for visualization
- ✅ Educational disclaimer
